# Basic-Ransomware-Tool
<p align="justify"> For my COMSEC2 elective project, I developed a simple ransomware detection tool using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework ideal for building small, fast, and flexible applications. The tool monitors files to detect when they are added or modified and presents the results through a simple, user-friendly interface. Flaskâ€™s minimal design and seamless integration with Python make it perfect for quickly developing and demonstrating this type of security solution. </p>

**How to run:**

Step 1: Fork this repository to your own.

Step 2: Create your own codespace in your own environment/repository.

Step 3. Open "cd ./ransomware_detection_py/" in the terminal to have access in that directory.

Step 4. Type "python app.py", and then a port will open for you.

**How to test:**

Since this is just a simple tool application, you'll be adding the files manually to test it. (Disclaimer, this is for a simple school project).

Step 1. In your codespace go to files on the left side of the codespace.

Step 2: Click the folder named "monitor".

Step 3. Right click that folder and any file, it can either be txt for example.

Step 4. Go back to the open port app and click "start monitoring".

Step 5. It will now scan the codespace files if any files were added or modified.

Step 6. To exit, just simply press in your keyboard "CTRL+C" to quit.

That's all for this application, hope you appreciated it.
